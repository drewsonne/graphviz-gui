# graphviz-gui

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/drewsonne/graphviz-gui.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/drewsonne/graphviz-gui)

This graphviz application will load the graph dynamically as changes are made to the file.
I built this application because I needed a graphviz app,
which would reload the opened file as it was being edited.
